# Signet

A modern NIP-46 remote signer for Nostr. Manages multiple keys securely with a web dashboard for administration. This project was originally forked from [nsecbunkerd](https://github.com/kind-0/nsecbunkerd), but has since received an extensive rewrite.

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Letdown2491/signet
cd signet
pnpm install
docker compose up --build
```

This launches:
- Daemon + REST API on `http://localhost:3000`
- Web dashboard on `http://localhost:4174`

> **Note:** Signet is designed for self-hosters on trusted networks (Tailscale, Wireguard, local LAN). There is no login page - access control is handled at the network layer. Public internet deployment with authentication is planned for a future release.

Add keys via CLI (optional) or through the web UI (simpler):

```bash
docker compose run --rm signet add --name main-key
```

## Development Setup

**Prereqs:** Node.js 20+, pnpm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Letdown2491/signet
cd signet
pnpm install
```

Start the daemon:

```bash
cd apps/signet
pnpm run build
pnpm run prisma:migrate
pnpm run signet start
```

Optionally, you could add keys and start the daemon from the CLI with a specific key directly:

```bash
cd apps/signet
pnpm run build
pnpm run prisma:migrate
# Add a key via CLI (prompts for passphrase and nsec)
pnpm run signet add --name main-key
# Start with a key already unlocked (prompts for passphrase)
pnpm run signet start --key main-key
```

Start the UI dev server (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd apps/signet-ui
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4174` to access the dashboard. From there you can add keys, connect apps, and manage signing requests.

## Configuration

Config is auto-generated on first boot at `~/.signet-config/signet.json`.

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for all options.

## Security

Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM (PBKDF2, 600k iterations). API endpoints require JWT auth with CORS and rate limiting.

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full security model.
